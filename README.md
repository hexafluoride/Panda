This was a challenge to write a complete file upload service in 100 lines total. I do not recommend using this on an actual website.

## What works?
* File uploading(duh)
* Complete [pomf API](https://git.clsr.net/gomf/plain/pomf-standard.txt) compliance
* Redirection to original file names from file IDs
